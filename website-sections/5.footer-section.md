Component Specification: Hybrid Footer & Location Map

1.  Layout Architecture

    Concept: "The Split-Screen Anchor." A distinct visual break from the rest of the site.
    Desktop Structure: 50/50 Horizontal Split.
    Left Zone (50vw): Interactive Location Map.
    Right Zone (50vw): Content & Brand Footer.
    Mobile Structure: Vertical Stack.
    Top Block: Full-width Map (Height: 40vh).
    Bottom Block: Full-width Content Footer.

2.  Left Zone: Geo-Intelligence (Map)

    Integrate with google maps, so the user can click and directed to google maps application.
    Map Styling: Custom JSON Styling. Do NOT use default Google colors. Use a "Clinical Dark" or "Muted Slate" theme (desaturated roads, blue water) to blend seamlessly with the footer's Deep Navy background.
    Functionality: Pinned to Address #1.
    UX: Scroll-zoom disabled by default (requires distinct click/tap to activate) to prevent "scroll trapping" when users try to reach the footer.

3.  Right Zone: Information Hub

    Visual Base: Solid Deep Medical Navy (#1F2A38). Text is White (#FFFFFF).

    Grid Layout (Internal): A 2x2 Quadrant system.

        Quadrant 1 (Top-Left): Clinical Locations
            Header: "Locații" (Small, Uppercase, Turquoise accent).
            Address 1: (Primary - Bold). Clickable -> Centers the Map.
            Address 2: (Secondary - Regular).
            Vibe: Clean typography, generous line-height for readability.

        Quadrant 2 (Top-Right): Digital Connect
            Layout: Vertical Flex Column, Aligned Right.
            Content: Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp/Phone.
            Styling: Text links or minimal icons. Hovering triggers a "slide-left" animation effect.

        Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Left): Quick Links & Meta
            Nav: "Live Yoga" | "Kinetoterapie" (Simple text links).
            Copyright: "© 2026 Rebalance." (Opacity 0.5, font-size 12px).

        Quadrant 4 (Bottom-Right): The Brand Seal
            Asset: Large "REBALANCE" Logo Icon.
            Placement: Absolute anchoring in the Bottom-Right corner.
            Styling: Large scale, slight transparency (20%), potentially bleeding off the edge slightly to create an "Editorial Magazine" finish.

4.  Responsive Adaptation

    Mobile Flow:
    The "Social Vertical" (Quad 2) transforms into a horizontal row for easier thumb access.
    The Map is placed above the text so users see "Where we are" before "Who we are."
    Padding is increased (24px) to ensure touch targets are safe.
