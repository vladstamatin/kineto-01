Component Specification: Hero Section (Video Grid)

1. Layout Structure

   Type: Vertical Stacked Grid (Bento-style rows).
   Composition: Three distinct horizontal video containers stacked vertically.
   Separators: 2px Solid White lines (#FFFFFF) separating each video container to create a clean, segmented grid look.
   Overlay: A generic grey/black semi-transparent overlay (background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3)) on all videos to ensure text legibility.

2. Video Row Dimensions & Positioning

   Global Variable: Assume standard Navbar Height (--nav-height) is approx 80px.
   Row 1 (Top):
   Positioning: Starts at top: 0, physically located behind the transparent Navigation Bar.
   Height: Exactly 2x Navbar Height (approx 160px).
   Z-Index: 0 (Navbar is 1000).
   Row 2 (Middle):
   Height: Exactly 1x Navbar Height (approx 80px).
   Row 3 (Bottom):
   Height: Exactly 1x Navbar Height (approx 80px).

3. Typography & Content

   Text Placement: Centered horizontally and vertically within each video container.
   Style: Clean Sans-Serif (Manrope), Solid White text, Medium weight.
   Content Mapping:
   Row 1 Text: "Salut" (Greeting).
   Row 2 Text: "Kinetoterapie" (Core Service).
   Row 3 Text: "Yoga . Pilates" (Wellness).

4. Visual Assets & Media (Placeholder Strategy)

   Video Implementation: Use standard HTML5 <video> tags with autoplay loop muted playsinline.
   Asset Logic:
   Since final assets are pending, generate/reference 3 placeholder video files in an /assets/ folder.
   Filenames: hero-video-1.mp4, hero-video-2.mp4, hero-video-3.mp4.
   Placeholder Content: For the purpose of this build, use simple 3-second loop placeholders (solid color shifting or simple noise) to validate the layout functionality without consuming heavy bandwidth.

5. Technical Implementation Notes

   Responsive Behavior: On mobile, maintain the aspect ratios but ensure text scales down to fit the smaller height strips.
   Performance: Videos must lazy-load if possible, but Row 1 must prioritize LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).
   Interaction: No hover effects on the videos themselves; they serve as an ambient, dynamic background layer.
