Component Specification: Specialist "Living" Cards

1. Layout & Grid Architecture

   Structure: High-density Responsive Grid.
   Desktop: 4-to-6 columns based on viewport width (grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr))). Cards are intentionally compact to show the breadth of the team at a glance.
   Mobile: Strict 2-column layout. Gaps are minimized (8px) to maximize image surface area on small screens.

2. The "Idle State" Card Media

   Technology: High-efficiency .webm or .webp loops (Cinemagraphs).
   Concept: "The Reassuring Presence." Instead of static photos, the doctor is captured in a 3-second seamless loop.
   Visual Direction: Subtle, non-verbal cues of active listening. A gentle shift of weight, a slight nod, or a relaxed breathing motion. They look ready to receive the patient.
   Vibe: Breaks the "white coat syndrome" by humanizing the medical professional before the appointment.

3. Overlay & Data Hierarchy

   Top-Left Anchor (Identity):
   Content: Doctor’s Name.
   Typography: White (#FFFFFF), Manrope Bold, 14px.
   Legibility: A custom CSS gradient overlay (background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgba(0,0,0,0.6) 0%, transparent 40%)) ensures the name is readable against any background footage.
   Bottom Anchor (Credentials):
   Container: A subtle "frosted glass" strip (Glassmorphism) or semi-transparent dark bar at the absolute bottom of the card.
   Content:
   Primary: Job Position (e.g., "Kinetoterapeut Senior"). Uppercase, tracking 1px, White.
   Secondary: Experience Badge (e.g., "12 Ani Exp."). Highlighted in the brand Turquoise (#00C4CC) to establish authority immediately.

4. Interaction & UX

   Hover State (Desktop): The "Idle" animation plays at 100% speed. When idle, it might run at 0.8x speed for calmness.
   Border Radius: Moderate (12px) to soften the edges.
   Performance: Implement IntersectionObserver. Only play the loop when the card is >20% visible in the viewport to save battery/data.
