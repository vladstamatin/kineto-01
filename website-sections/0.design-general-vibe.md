Design & Aesthetic Guidelines

1. Visual Direction & Inspiration Goal: Shift the perception from "clinical treatment" to "performance optimization." The aesthetic should bridge the gap between high-end medical care and a premium lifestyle brand. It must feel energetic, human-centric, and authoritative without being sterile.

Style References:

    Vibe: "Editorial Medical." Think high-contrast layouts, breathing room, and dynamic imagery similar to Myodetox or Bespoke Treatments.
    Imagery: Avoid generic stock doctors. Use high-quality, authentic photography of therapists in motion, hands-on treatment, and active recovery. Focus on the result of movement.

2. Color Palette Theme Base: Clean White (#FFFFFF) & Soft Light Grey (#F8F9FA). Primary Brand Colors (Extracted from Logo):

   Primary Palette:
   Rebalance Turquoise: #00C4CC (The vibrant active color from the logo icon).
   Deep Medical Navy: #1F2A38 (The dark, authoritative text color from the logo).
   Secondary Palette:
   Slate Grey: #4A5568 (For body text, softer than black).
   Muted Sage: #E6FFFA (Background accent for "calm" zones). Usage Rule: Use the Rebalance Turquoise sparingly for CTAs (Call to Actions) and high-impact accents. The Deep Navy anchors the headers and navigation for stability.

3. Typography Font Family: Manrope or Plus Jakarta Sans.

   Styling:
   Headings: Bold, tight tracking, uppercase for section markers (similar to sports branding).
   Body: High legibility, 16px base size, generous line height (1.6) to reduce cognitive load. Layout: Asymmetric grids to create dynamic flow, breaking the rigid "medical chart" structure.
   Layout: Use 4px grid system for margins, adapt for mobile and desktop.

4. Background & Animation Base: Minimalist white.

   Texture/Depth: Use subtle, organic "fluid" shapes in very light grey/turquoise opacity (5%) to represent movement and fluidity (kinetotherapy), avoiding rigid grid lines. Motion: Elements should slide up with a "soft ease" curve. Hover states on buttons should be snappy and reactive, mimicking physical responsiveness.
