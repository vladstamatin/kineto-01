Component Specification: Services & Pricing Matrix

1. Kinetic Service Ticker (Top Banner)

   Concept: An infinite horizontal marquee loop acting as a dynamic visual breaker between the Hero and the Pricing section.
   Content: Repeated sequence: "Terapie Manuală • Kinetoterapie • Drenaj Limfatic • Drenaj Bronșic • Terapie ATM • Terapie Viscerală • Gimnastică Schroth • Taping • Osteopatie •"
   Behavior:
   Desktop: Single line, moderate speed, opacity 0.8.
   Mobile: Two stacked rows moving in opposite directions (Parallax effect) to ensure readability without tiny fonts.
   Styling: Large, Outline-style typography (transparent fill, dark stroke) or bold uppercase text in var(--medical-navy).

2. Split-Layout Pricing Grid

   Structure: Asymmetric 2-Column Grid.
   Left Column (60%): Scrollable Service List & Price Data.
   Right Column (40%): Sticky Visual Anchor.
   Behavior: As the user scrolls through the text list on the left, the image on the right updates dynamically to match the visible category.

3. Content Architecture (Left Column)

   Item Design: Flexbox row.
   Service Name: Left aligned, Manrope Medium, Dark Grey.
   Connector: Dotted leader line (................) filling the space.
   Price: Right aligned, Bold, Turquoise accent.
   Grouping Logic (for Image Mapping):
   Group A (Manual Therapy): Adult, Adolescent, Baby sessions.
   Group B (Specialized): Visceral, ATM, Lymphatic Drainage.
   Group C (Subscriptions/Abonamente): 5/10 session packages.

4. Visual Anchor (Right Column)

   Component: A tall, vertical image container with Heavy Rounded Corners (24px).
   Functionality: "Sticky" positioning. The container stays fixed in the viewport while the list scrolls.
   Transition: Fade-in/Fade-out transition (300ms ease) between images when the user reaches a new service group (e.g., scrolling from "Manual Therapy" to "Visceral" triggers an image swap).

5. Mobile Adaptation

   Layout Change: Stacked View.
   Logic: The "Sticky Image" is removed. Instead, place a static, relevant image between the major categories (e.g., List Group A -> Image -> List Group B).
   Touch: Increase vertical padding on price rows (min 44px height) for easier readability on small screens.
